# AOOSTAR GEM12 PRO MAX / WTR MAX Screen Control

The code provided is based on the reverse engineering published by [zehnm/aoostar-rs](https://github.com/zehnm/aoostar-rs) and there's no guarantee that it's going to function correctly or safely on your hardware, be careful.

My tests were made solely on a GEM12 PRO MAX (the WTR MAX in [zehnm/aoostar-rs](https://github.com/zehnm/aoostar-rs) and the GEM12 PRO MAX both use the same software variant).

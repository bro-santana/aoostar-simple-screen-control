# AOOSTAR GEM12 PRO MAX / GEM12+ PRO / WTR MAX Screen Control

### ⚠ Main functionality : in progress ⚠ 

The code provided is based on the reverse engineering published by [zehnm/aoostar-rs](https://github.com/zehnm/aoostar-rs).

My tests were made solely on a **GEM12 PRO MAX**.

Both **GEM12+ PRO** and the **GEM12 PRO MAX** use the same software variant with the same configs, so the **GEM12+ PRO** is expected to be compatible.

The **WTR MAX** is also selectable in the Aoostar-X software for the **GEM12+ PRO** and the **GEM12 PRO MAX**, with the only warning that TDPs are different; the reverse-engineered protocol in [zehnm/aoostar-rs](https://github.com/zehnm/aoostar-rs) was based on the **WTR MAX**, and so it is also expected to be compatible.

⚠ But, as a warning, independent of your mini PC model, there’s no guarantee that it’s going to function correctly or safely on your hardware. Be careful. ⚠

## Images

Panel images provided were reconstructed to look similar to Aoostar X's data, avoiding using ther artwork.
The Photoshop file with the reconstruction is available for possible further customization.


⚠ AI USE WARNING⚠ : There was no AI image generation used on default_1_hdd.jpg and default_1_index.jpg. There was AI image generation used to reconstruct the background from default_2_hdd.jpg,default_2_index.jpg,default_3_hdd.jpg,default_3_index.jpg,default_3_hdd.jpg and default_3_index.jpg to something similar to the original, I'm currently looking for alternative similar backgrounds.

# AOOSTAR GEM12 PRO MAX / GEM12+ PRO / WTR MAX Screen Control

The code provided is based on the reverse engineering published by [zehnm/aoostar-rs](https://github.com/zehnm/aoostar-rs).

My tests were made solely on a **GEM12 PRO MAX**.

Both **GEM12+ PRO** and the **GEM12 PRO MAX** use the same software variant with the same configs, so the **GEM12+ PRO** is expected to be compatible.

The **WTR MAX** is also selectable in the Aoostar-X software for the **GEM12+ PRO** and the **GEM12 PRO MAX**, with the only warning that TDPs are different; the reverse-engineered protocol in [zehnm/aoostar-rs](https://github.com/zehnm/aoostar-rs) was based on the **WTR MAX**, and so it is also expected to be compatible.

⚠ But, as a warning, independent of your mini PC model, there’s no guarantee that it’s going to function correctly or safely on your hardware. Be careful. ⚠
